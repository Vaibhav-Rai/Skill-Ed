## My Project - Electrostatic Spray Gun (360° Coverage)
My project is a device that can be used to create a practically inexhaustible supply of this disinfecting solution (HOCL) on-site and on-demand in a matter of just minutes and at no cost. All you need is Salt, Electricity and Water. This generator can then be designed into a tank which will be combined with the Electrostatic Spray Gun.


### Components
1.	Electrostatic Nozzle (with charge controller) – atomize output spray particles in the range of 40 to 120 microns (for variable dwell time)
2.	Tank or Container (normal) /(with a HOCL Generator) – may be combined
3.	Electrolysis Cells and Electrodes (Ground and Negative)
4.	Charging Module or Voltage Generator (source Battery / Electric Supply)
5.	Pumpand/or Motor, Compressor (pulls the liquid from the container for siphoning – applying force to the solution which atomizes with the nozzles)
6.	Charging Ring (just behind atomizer nozzle)–generates all ions positive
7.	Trigger and/or Switch
8.	Pipe
9.	Casing
10.	Charging / Power Socket

### Description
Based on the nature's law, wherein Opposite charges attract and Like charges repel each other, this electrostatic spraying system works. Electrostatic spray surface disinfection involves spraying electrostatically charged particles (of water-based disinfectant solutions) onto surfaces that can forcefully stick to and coat the objects or any surface they're targeted at. The nature of the Electrostatic charged particles permits it to coat evenly on uneven shaped objects surfaces even if the particles are only sprayed from one side. As the chemical exits from the electrostatic sprayer, it's given a positive electrical charge. So, the output droplets become attracted to all negative surfaces, covering the visible area, underside and backside, with the sanitizing/disinfectant agent. Surfaces that are already covered repel the spray particles to cover more surface area and thus the sanitizing/disinfectant solution never overlaps each other, thus giving this mechanism the desired efficiency and effectiveness. After the spray is applied, the sanitizing agent attempts to disinfect the covered surfaces. Thus, electrostatic sprayer can be one of the most effective and efficient solution for disinfectant sprayer mechanism.

### Benefits over other spray technologies
-	Reduces time taken (up to 50%) to cover & disinfect all surfaces and hard-to-reach places 
-	Improves infection control and the spread of microbes 
-	Applies chemicals in a more efficient & controlled manner, eliminating the risk of chemical overuse 
-	Distant targets and unreachable corners can be conveniently covered 
-	Almost 20% small micron Particles (size 50-55 micron) which are more effective and efficient evaporate easily before reaching to target in more than 30°C ambient temperature and natural air wind which is very common in most of countries. This mechanism ensures reach of small micron particles sprayed in environment up to 40°C to 45°C ambient temperature
-	Saves money & economical compared to others (low consumption of sanitizing/disinfectant solutions)
-	Easily Portable

### About the Disinfectant Solution
Hypochlorous acid (HOCL) is a green, safe, environmentally friendly and fully biodegradable liquid which acts as a very powerful antimicrobial and sterilizing solution. It is considered part of the engineered (electrolyzed) water category of products and can be used for sanitizing and disinfecting. HOCL is able to provide safe and superior disinfection capabilities for any tasks that the current commercially widespread disinfectant solution classes viz., Sodium Hypochlorite (Chlorine Bleach), Hydrogen Peroxide products and Quaternary Ammonium Compounds (aka quats) are already used for. However, because of its very short life (up to 4 hours), it needs to be made from a machine on-site and on-demand for usage, which has limited its commercial applications.
